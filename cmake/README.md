# Building with CMake

CMake 3.29 or newer, Ninja, and Swift 6.2 or newer are required. Ninja Multi-Config
requires CMake 4.0 or newer. SwiftPM remains the test runner for the Swift unit tests.

On Windows, run CMake from a Visual Studio developer command prompt so the MSVC
linker and Windows SDK are available.

Configure, build, and install the libraries:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```

Pass `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` to build shared libraries. An enclosing CMake project
can also use `add_subdirectory` and link the namespaced targets. The build directory
and install prefix both provide a `SwiftServiceContext` package configuration.

The independent consumer verifies that public modules can be imported and linked:

```sh
cmake -S Tests/CMake -B consumer -G Ninja -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/install
cmake --build consumer
ctest --test-dir consumer --output-on-failure
```

Test relocated installations by moving the installation prefix before configuring the consumer.
For Ninja Multi-Config, pass `--config Debug` to build/install and `-C Debug` to CTest.
