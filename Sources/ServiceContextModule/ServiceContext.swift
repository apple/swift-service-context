/// A Service Context is a heterogeneous storage type with value semantics that provides keyed values in a type-safe fashion.
///
/// Its values are uniquely identified with ``ServiceContextKey``,  by type identity.
/// These keys also dictate the type of value allowed for a specific key-value pair through their associated type `Value`.
///
/// ### Defining keys and accessing values
/// Define ``ServiceContext`` keys as types  which conform to the ``ServiceContextKey`` protocol:
/// Specify the types using case-less enums as no actual instances are required.
///
/// ```swift
/// private enum TestIDKey: ServiceContextKey {
///   typealias Value = String
/// }
/// ```
///
/// When defining a key, also declare an extension on `ServiceContext` to allow convenient and discoverable ways to interact
/// with the context item. The extension should take the form of:
///
///  ```swift
/// extension ServiceContext {
///   var testID: String? {
///     get {
///       self[TestIDKey.self]
///     } set {
///       self[TestIDKey.self] = newValue
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// For consistency, name key types with a `...Key` suffix (for example, `SomethingKey`) and the property
/// used to access a value identifier by such key the prefix of the key (for example `something`).
/// Please also observe the usual Swift naming conventions, such as prefering `ID` to `Id`, and so on.
///
/// ### Usage
/// Using a context container is fairly straight forward, as it boils down to using the prepared computed properties:
///
/// ```swift
/// var context = ServiceContext.topLevel
///
/// // set a new value
/// context.testID = "abc"
///
/// // retrieve a stored value
/// let testID = context.testID ?? "default"
///
/// // remove a stored value
/// context.testIDKey = nil
/// ```
///
/// Note that normally a context should not be "created" ad-hoc by user code, but rather passed to it from
/// a runtime. A `ServiceContext` may already be available to you through `ServiceContext.$current` when using structured concurrency.
/// Otherwise, for example when working in an HTTP server framework, it is most likely that the context is already passed
/// directly or indirectly (such as in a `FrameworkContext`).
///
/// ### Accessing all values
///
/// The only way to access "all" values in a context is the `forEach` function.
/// `ServiceContext` intentionally doesn't expose more functions to prevent abuse and developers treating it as too much of an
/// arbitrary value smuggling container.
/// This makes it convenient for tracing and instrumentation systems which need to access either specific or all items carried inside a context.
public struct ServiceContext: Sendable {
    private var _storage = [AnyServiceContextKey: Sendable]()

    /// Internal on purpose, please use ``ServiceContext/TODO(_:function:file:line:)`` or ``ServiceContext/topLevel`` to create an "empty" context,
    /// which carries more meaning to other developers why an empty context was used.
    init() {}

// MARK: - Creating ServiceContext

extension ServiceContext {
    /// Creates a new empty top level context.
    ///
    /// Generally used as an initial context to immediately be populated with some values by a framework or runtime.
    ///
    /// Another use case is for tasks starting in the "background" (such as on a timer),
    /// which don't have a "request context" that they can pick up, and as such they have to create a "top level"
    /// context for their work.
    ///
    /// ### Usage in frameworks and libraries
    /// This function is intended to be used by frameworks and libraries, at the "top-level" where a request's,
    /// message's, or task's processing is initiated. For example, a framework handling requests should create an empty
    /// context when handling a request and immediately populate it with useful trace information extracted from a carrier,
    /// such as an HTTP request and the request's headers.
    ///
    /// ### Usage in applications
    /// Application code should never have to create an empty context during the processing lifetime of any request,
    /// and only create context if some processing is performed in the background - thus the naming of this property.
    ///
    /// Usually, a framework such as an HTTP server or similar "request handler" would already provide users
    /// with a context to pass along through subsequent calls, either implicitly through the task-local `ServiceContext.$current`
    /// or explicitly as part of some kind of "FrameworkContext".
    ///
    /// If you are unsure where to obtain a context from, prefer using `.TODO("Not sure where I should get a context from here?")`
    /// in order to inform other developers that the lack of context passing was not done on purpose, but rather because you either
    /// weren't sure where to obtain a context from, or other framework limitations -- for example the outer framework not being
    /// context aware just yet.

extension ServiceContext {
    /// A context intended as a placeholder until a real value can be passed through a function call.
    ///
    /// This type should ONLY be used while prototyping or when the passing of the proper context is not yet possible,
    /// for example because an external library did not pass it correctly and has to be fixed before the proper context
    /// can be obtained where the TO-DO is currently used.
    ///
    /// ### Crashing on TO-DO context creation
    /// You may set the `SERVICE_CONTEXT_CRASH_TODOS` swift definition while compiling a project in order to make calls to this function crash
    /// with a fatal error, which indicates where a to-do context is used. This comes in handy when you want to ensure that
    /// a project never ends up using code which initially was written as "was lazy, did not pass context", yet the
    /// project requires context passing to be done correctly throughout the application. Similar checks can be performed
    /// at compile time easily using linters (not yet implemented), since it is always valid enough to detect a to-do context
    /// being passed as illegal and warn or error when spotted.
    ///
    /// ### Example
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// let context = ServiceContext.TODO("The framework XYZ should be modified to pass us a context here, and we'd pass it along"))
    /// ```
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - reason: Informational reason for developers, why a placeholder context was used instead of a proper one.
    ///   - function: The function to which the TODO refers.
    ///   - file: The file to which the TODO refers.
    ///   - line: The line to which the TODO refers.
    /// - Returns: Empty "to-do" context which should be eventually replaced with a carried through one, or `topLevel`.
