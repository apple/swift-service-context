/// A `Baggage` is a heterogeneous storage type with value semantics for keyed values in a type-safe fashion.
///
/// Its values are uniquely identified via ``BaggageKey``s (by type identity). These keys also dictate the type of
/// value allowed for a specific key-value pair through their associated type `Value`.
///
/// ## Defining keys and accessing values
/// Baggage keys are defined as types, most commonly case-less enums (as no actual instances are required)
/// which conform to the ``BaggageKey`` protocol:
///
///     private enum TestIDKey: BaggageKey {
///       typealias Value = String
///     }
///
/// While defining a key, one should also immediately declare an extension on `Baggage` to allow convenient and discoverable ways to interact
/// with the baggage item. The extension should take the form of:
///
///     extension Baggage {
///       var testID: String? {
///         get {
///           self[TestIDKey.self]
///         } set {
///           self[TestIDKey.self] = newValue
///         }
///       }
///     }
///
/// For consistency, it is recommended to name key types with the `...Key` suffix (e.g. `SomethingKey`) and the property
/// used to access a value identifier by such key the prefix of the key (e.g. `something`). Please also observe the usual
/// Swift naming conventions, e.g. prefer `ID` to `Id` etc.
///
/// ## Usage
/// Using a baggage container is fairly straight forward, as it boils down to using the prepared computed properties:
///
///     var baggage = Baggage.topLevel
///     // set a new value
///     baggage.testID = "abc"
///     // retrieve a stored value
///     let testID = baggage.testID ?? "default"
///     // remove a stored value
///     baggage.testIDKey = nil
///
/// Note that normally a baggage should not be "created" ad-hoc by user code, but rather it should be passed to it from
/// a runtime. A `Baggage` may already be available to you through Baggage.$current when using structured concurrency.
/// Otherwise, for example when working in an HTTP server framework, it is most likely that the baggage is already passed
/// directly or indirectly (e.g. in a `FrameworkContext`).
///
/// ### Accessing all values
///
/// The only way to access "all" values in a baggage is by using the `forEach` function.
/// `Baggage` does not expose more functions on purpose to prevent abuse and treating it as too much of an
/// arbitrary value smuggling container, but only make it convenient for tracing and instrumentation systems which need
/// to access either specific or all items carried inside a baggage.
public struct Baggage: _Baggage_Sendable {
    private var _storage = [AnyBaggageKey: _Baggage_Sendable]()

    /// Internal on purpose, please use ``Baggage/TODO(_:function:file:line:)`` or ``Baggage/topLevel`` to create an "empty" baggage,
    /// which carries more meaning to other developers why an empty baggage was used.

// MARK: - Creating Baggage

extension Baggage {
    /// Creates a new empty "top level" baggage, generally used as an "initial" baggage to immediately be populated with
    /// some values by a framework or runtime. Another use case is for tasks starting in the "background" (e.g. on a timer),
    /// which don't have a "request context" per se that they can pick up, and as such they have to create a "top level"
    /// baggage for their work.
    ///
    /// ## Usage in frameworks and libraries
    /// This function is really only intended to be used by frameworks and libraries, at the "top-level" where a request's,
    /// message's or task's processing is initiated. For example, a framework handling requests, should create an empty
    /// baggage when handling a request only to immediately populate it with useful trace information extracted from e.g.
    /// request headers.
    ///
    /// ## Usage in applications
    /// Application code should never have to create an empty baggage during the processing lifetime of any request,
    /// and only should create baggages if some processing is performed in the background - thus the naming of this property.
    ///
    /// Usually, a framework such as an HTTP server or similar "request handler" would already provide users
    /// with a context to be passed along through subsequent calls, either implicitly through the task-local `Baggage.$current`
    /// or explicitly as part of some kind of "FrameworkContext".
    ///
    /// If unsure where to obtain a baggage from, prefer using `.TODO("Not sure where I should get a context from here?")`
    /// in order to inform other developers that the lack of baggage passing was not done on purpose, but rather because either
    /// not being sure where to obtain a baggage from, or other framework limitations -- e.g. the outer framework not being
    /// baggage aware just yet.

    /// can be obtained where the TO-DO is currently used.
    ///
    /// ## Crashing on TO-DO context creation
    /// You may set the `BAGGAGE_CRASH_TODOS` variable while compiling a project in order to make calls to this function crash
    /// with a fatal error, indicating where a to-do baggage was used. This comes in handy when wanting to ensure that
    /// a project never ends up using code which initially was written as "was lazy, did not pass baggage", yet the
    /// project requires baggage passing to be done correctly throughout the application. Similar checks can be performed
    /// at compile time easily using linters (not yet implemented), since it is always valid enough to detect a to-do context
    /// being passed as illegal and warn or error when spotted.
