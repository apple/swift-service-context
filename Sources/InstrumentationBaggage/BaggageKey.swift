/// Baggage keys provide type-safe access to ``Baggage``s by declaring the type of value they "key" at compile-time.
/// To give your `BaggageKey` an explicit name you may override the ``BaggageKey/nameOverride-2upe8`` property.
///
/// In general, `BaggageKey`s should be `internal` or `private` to the part of a system using it.
///
/// All access to baggage items should be performed through an accessor computed property defined as shown below:
///
///     /// The Key type should be internal (or private).
///     enum TestIDKey: BaggageKey {
///         typealias Value = String
///         static var nameOverride: String? { "test-id" }
///     }
///
///     extension Baggage {
///         /// This is some useful property documentation.
///         public internal(set) var testID: String? {
///             get {
///                 self[TestIDKey.self]
///             }
///             set {
///                 self[TestIDKey.self] = newValue
///             }
///         }
